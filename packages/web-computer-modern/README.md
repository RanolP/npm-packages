# web-computer-modern

This package offers a woff2 version of [New Computer Modern](https://ctan.org/pkg/newcomputermodern) font family maintained by [Antonis Tsolomitis](https://ctan.org/author/tsolomitis). You can download original files from [CTAN Mirror](https://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/newcomputermodern.zip) if you want.

## Main Differences

- Use "WebCM" as font family name consistently.
- Make "Book" font-weight 500.

## Contribution
